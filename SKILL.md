# Happiness Skill Assessment

Diagnose what's blocking peace of mind and prescribe practices to develop happiness as a skill, following Naval Ravikant's framework: Happiness = Peace - Desire.

**Token Budget:** ~1100 tokens

---

## Constraints
- Do NOT replace professional mental health treatment
- Do NOT dismiss clinical conditions as "just desire"
- Acknowledge limits of philosophical frameworks for serious issues
- Recommend professional help when appropriate

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Why am I not happy?"
- User asks "How do I find peace?"
- User feels anxious about the future
- User feels trapped on the hedonic treadmill
- User wants a practical approach to contentment

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Current state | Yes | What the user is experiencing/feeling |
| Desires | Helpful | What they're chasing or wanting |
| Context | Optional | Life situation, stressors |

---

## The Core Framework

### The Happiness Equation

**Happiness = Peace - Desire**

- **Peace:** Contentment with the present moment
- **Desire:** A contract to be unhappy until you get what you want
- **Happiness:** Not positive thinking; absence of grasping

**Key insight:** "Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want."

### The Mind Problem

"What we seek is not peace of mind, but peace FROM mind."

- A busy mind accelerates perceived time
- The mind exists in motion toward future or past
- Fewer desires = less mental movement = more peace

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Desire Inventory

Identify active desires creating future-orientation:

| Desire | Type | Impact on Present |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| {desire 1} | Achievement / Possession / Recognition | {blocking peace} |
| {desire 2} | Achievement / Possession / Recognition | {blocking peace} |

Ask: "What contract have you signed with yourself to be unhappy until X happens?"

### Step 2: Busy Mind Assessment

Evaluate mental state:

| Indicator | Present? | Impact |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Constant planning/worrying | Yes/No | Future-orientation |
| Ruminating on past | Yes/No | Past-orientation |
| Difficulty sitting still without input | Yes/No | Addiction to stimulation |
| Feeling time passes too quickly | Yes/No | Mind moving too fast |

### Step 3: Peace Practices Audit

What's currently supporting peace?

| Practice | Current State | Prescription |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Meditation | None/Sporadic/Regular | {recommendation} |
| Time in nature | None/Sporadic/Regular | {recommendation} |
| Physical exercise | None/Sporadic/Regular | {recommendation} |
| Undistracted solitude | None/Sporadic/Regular | {recommendation} |
| Sleep quality | Poor/Adequate/Good | {recommendation} |

### Step 4: The One Desire Filter

Naval says: "Pick your one overwhelming desire. It's okay to suffer over that one."

Ask: "If you could only keep one desire, which would it be?"
- Having one focused desire is better than many competing desires
- This creates clarity and reduces mental fragmentation

### Step 5: Prescribe Practices

Based on diagnosis, recommend specific practices:

| Practice | Frequency | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Morning meditation | Daily | Clear mental inbox |
| Nature exposure | Daily | Reset nervous system |
| Gratitude focus | Daily | Train present-orientation |
| Desire questioning | When desire arises | Break the contract |

## Happiness Skill Assessment

### Current State
{Summary of what user is experiencing}

### Desire Inventory
| Desire | Type | Unhappiness Contract |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| {desire} | {type} | "I will be unhappy until..." |

### Mind Assessment
- **Orientation:** Past / Present / Future
- **Speed:** Slow / Normal / Racing
- **Core blocker:** {main thing preventing peace}

### The Diagnosis
{What's specifically blocking peace}

### Prescription

| Practice | Frequency | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| {practice 1} | {frequency} | {purpose} |
| {practice 2} | {frequency} | {purpose} |

### The Core Shift
{The fundamental reframe needed}

### Remember
"A happy person isn't someone who's happy all the time. It's someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don't lose their innate peace."
```

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**User:** "I got the promotion I wanted but I'm already thinking about the next one. I can't seem to enjoy anything. I'm always anxious about what's next."

**Skill Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Happiness Skill Assessment

### Current State
Achievement unlocked, but no satisfaction. Already oriented toward next goal.

### Desire Inventory
| Desire | Type | Unhappiness Contract |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| Next promotion | Achievement | "I'll be happy when I'm at the next level" |
| Recognition | Status | "I'll be content when I'm seen as successful" |
| Security | Fear-based | "I'll relax when I have enough" |

### Mind Assessment
- **Orientation:** Future (always next thing)
- **Speed:** Racing (can't be still)
- **Core blocker:** You've made achievement your happiness strategy, but achievements don't compound into contentment. They compound into more desire.

### The Diagnosis
You're on a hedonic treadmill. Each achievement raises the bar, and the bar raising IS the source of your unhappiness. The promotion didn't fail to make you happy - you failed to let it make you happy because you immediately signed a new contract: "Now I'll be happy when the NEXT thing happens."

The issue isn't insufficient achievement. It's that you're using achievement as a happiness strategy. Achievement is for wealth. Happiness requires dropping desire.

### Prescription

| Practice | Frequency | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Sit without agenda | 10 min/morning | Practice being with no next thing |
| Notice the achievement | When it arises | Pause and actually receive what you've done |
| Question the contract | When new desire arises | Ask: "Will I really be happy then, or will I just move the goalpost?" |
| One desire rule | Daily | Pick one thing to care about, release the rest |

### The Core Shift
You're treating happiness as an outcome of achievement. But happiness is peace, and peace is the absence of desire. You won't find peace by achieving more. You'll find it by wanting less.

The promotion wasn't supposed to make you happy. YOU were supposed to make you happy. The promotion was just an event.

### Remember
"A busy calendar and a busy mind will destroy your ability to do great things in this world." Including the great thing of being at peace.

## Integration

This skill is part of the Naval Ravikant expert. After assessment, consider:

- **Wealth vs. Status Diagnosis** - Is the desire for status or genuine wealth?
- **First Principles Breakdown** - Question assumptions about what creates happiness
- **Specific Knowledge Discovery** - Find work that feels like play (reduces desire-stress)

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Signs of clinical depression/anxiety | Recommend professional support first |
| User resistant to "just want less" | Acknowledge difficulty; focus on practices |
| External circumstances genuinely difficult | Validate; peace is possible even in hardship |
| User needs achievement for survival | Distinguish necessary goals from status-desire |
