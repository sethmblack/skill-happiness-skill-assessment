# Happiness Skill Assessment

Diagnose what's blocking peace of mind and prescribe practices to develop happiness as a skill, following Naval Ravikant's framework: Happiness = Peace - Desire. Naval's insight is that happiness is not a destination achieved through external accomplishments but a skill that can be trained like any other. The core equation is simple: happiness equals peace minus desire. Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. The goal is not positive thinking but the absence of grasping. "What we seek is not peace of mind, but peace FROM mind." A busy mind accelerates perceived time and creates constant future-orientation. Fewer desires equal less mental movement, which equals more peace.

## When to Use

- User asks "Why am I not happy?"
- User asks "How do I find peace?"
- User feels anxious about the future
- User feels trapped on the hedonic treadmill
- User wants a practical approach to contentment
- Achievement hasn't produced expected satisfaction

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_state | Yes | What the user is experiencing/feeling |
| desires | No | What they're chasing or wanting |
| context | No | Life situation, stressors |

---

## Core Principle

Happiness = Peace - Desire. Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. A happy person is not someone who is happy all the time; it is someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don't lose their innate peace. Happiness is a skill that can be trained - not through positive thinking but through reducing the mental movement created by desire, judgment, and future-orientation.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Desire Inventory

1. Identify active desires creating future-orientation:
   - What contracts have you signed with yourself to be unhappy until X happens?
   - Categorize: Achievement desires, Possession desires, Recognition desires
   - Assess impact: How is each desire blocking present peace?

### Phase 2: Busy Mind Assessment

1. Evaluate mental state indicators:
   - Constant planning/worrying (future-orientation)
   - Ruminating on past (past-orientation)
   - Difficulty sitting still without input (addiction to stimulation)
   - Feeling time passes too quickly (mind moving too fast)

2. Determine mind orientation: Past / Present / Future
3. Determine mind speed: Slow / Normal / Racing

### Phase 3: Peace Practices Audit

1. Assess what's currently supporting peace:
   - Meditation: None / Sporadic / Regular
   - Time in nature: None / Sporadic / Regular
   - Physical exercise: None / Sporadic / Regular
   - Undistracted solitude: None / Sporadic / Regular
   - Sleep quality: Poor / Adequate / Good

### Phase 4: The One Desire Filter

1. Naval: "Pick your one overwhelming desire. It's okay to suffer over that one."
2. Ask: "If you could only keep one desire, which would it be?"
3. Having one focused desire is better than many competing desires
4. This creates clarity and reduces mental fragmentation

### Phase 5: Prescribe Practices

Based on diagnosis, recommend specific practices:

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Morning meditation | Clear mental inbox |
| Nature exposure | Reset nervous system |
| Gratitude focus | Train present-orientation |
| Desire questioning | Break the contract when desire arises |
| One desire focus | Reduce mental fragmentation |

## Constraints

- Do not replace professional mental health treatment
- Do not dismiss clinical conditions as "just desire"
- Acknowledge limits of philosophical frameworks for serious issues
- Recommend professional help when appropriate
- Do not minimize genuine hardship or suffering
- This framework is for trained happiness, not crisis intervention

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Just want less" as dismissive advice | Desire reduction is a practice developed over time, not a switch you flip |
| Treating clinical depression as desire problem | Clinical conditions require professional treatment, not philosophical reframes |
| Spiritual bypassing | Using these concepts to avoid dealing with legitimate problems requiring action |
| Forcing the framework on external circumstances | Some unhappiness signals real problems that need solving, not accepting |
| Expecting immediate results | Happiness as a skill takes years to develop; expect gradual progress |

## Examples

### Example 1: Post-Achievement Emptiness

**Situation:** "I got the promotion I wanted but I'm already thinking about the next one. I can't seem to enjoy anything. I'm always anxious about what's next."

**Application:**

**Desire Inventory:**

| Desire | Type | Unhappiness Contract |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| Next promotion | Achievement | "I'll be happy when I'm at the next level" |
| Recognition | Status | "I'll be content when I'm seen as successful" |
| Security | Fear-based | "I'll relax when I have enough" |

**Mind Assessment:**
- **Orientation:** Future (always next thing)
- **Speed:** Racing (can't be still)
- **Core blocker:** You've made achievement your happiness strategy, but achievements don't compound into contentment. They compound into more desire.

**The Diagnosis:** You're on a hedonic treadmill. Each achievement raises the bar, and the bar raising IS the source of your unhappiness. The promotion didn't fail to make you happy - you failed to let it make you happy because you immediately signed a new contract: "Now I'll be happy when the NEXT thing happens."

**Prescription:**

| Practice | Frequency | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Sit without agenda | 10 min/morning | Practice being with no next thing |
| Notice the achievement | When it arises | Pause and actually receive what you've done |
| Question the contract | When new desire arises | Ask: "Will I really be happy then, or will I just move the goalpost?" |
| One desire rule | Daily | Pick one thing to care about, release the rest |

**The Core Shift:** You're treating happiness as an outcome of achievement. But happiness is peace, and peace is the absence of desire. You won't find peace by achieving more. You'll find it by wanting less.

### Example 2: Comparison and Inadequacy

**Situation:** "I see my friends succeeding and I feel like I'm falling behind. I can't stop comparing myself to others."

**Application:**

**Desire Inventory:**

| Desire | Type | Unhappiness Contract |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| Being "ahead" | Comparison | "I'll be okay when I'm doing as well as them" |
| Avoiding judgment | Fear | "I'll relax when no one can look down on me" |

**Mind Assessment:**
- **Orientation:** Future (where I should be) and past (where others were at my age)
- **Speed:** Racing
- **Core blocker:** Comparison is a thief of peace. You've made your happiness dependent on a moving target you don't control.

**Prescription:**

| Practice | Frequency | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Social media fast | 1 week | Remove comparison triggers |
| Define your own game | Once, then revisit monthly | Success is playing your game well, not winning theirs |
| Gratitude practice | Daily | Train attention on what you have, not what others have |

**The Core Shift:** Their success is not your failure. You're running different races. The only comparison that matters is you versus you from yesterday.

## Integration

**Works with:**
- Mindfulness and meditation practices
- First principles thinking (question assumptions about happiness)
- Specific knowledge discovery (find work that feels like play)

**When to prefer this skill:**
- When external success hasn't produced internal peace
- When anxiety about future is chronic
- When seeking a systematic approach to contentment

**Cautions:**
- Signs of clinical depression/anxiety require professional support first
- Some unhappiness signals real problems requiring action, not acceptance
- This is a long-term practice, not a quick fix
